Launcify — workspace organization notes

Purpose
- Provide a quick map of this repository and a safe plan to declutter files into logical folders.

What I added
- `docs/FILE_MAP.md` — a short description of each top-level file and suggested destination folder.
- This `README.md` — explains next steps and a proposed safe reorder plan.

Proposed folder structure (non-destructive until you approve)
- `pages/` — all HTML pages except `index.html` (keeps home at root).
- `css/` — all .css files.
- `js/` — all .js files.
- `assets/` — images, icons, fonts, manifest, etc.
- `docs/` — documentation and file map.

Safe workflow I recommend
1. Review `docs/FILE_MAP.md` to confirm my inferred descriptions and destinations.
2. Approve automatic reorganization — I will copy files into folders, update HTML references, and keep backups of originals.
3. Test locally (`test-server.js` can be used) and verify visuals/workflows.
4. Remove backups when you're satisfied.

If you'd like, I can proceed to reorganize files now and update `index.html` and other pages to reference the new paths. Approve or tell me which files to keep at root.
